# Feature Extraction and Label Propagation with RoBERTa

## Feature Extraction

The provided code performs feature extraction from a combined dataset using the RoBERTa model. Here's a breakdown of the process:

### 1. Data Fetching

- The script fetches true and false news data from a Supabase database using `fetch_data_from_supabase` function.

### 2. Tokenization and Encoding

- RoBERTa tokenizer is used to tokenize and encode the text data.
- Encodings are truncated and padded to ensure uniform length.

### 3. Feature Extraction

- The `extract_roberta_features` function iterates over the encoded batches of data.
- For each batch, RoBERTa model is employed to extract features.
- Features are reshaped and concatenated to prepare them for storage.

### 4. Writing Features to Database

- Extracted features are stored in a Supabase database using `write_records_to_supabase`.

### 5. Memory Management

- Memory occupied by the batch features is freed after writing them to the database.

## Label Propagation

After extracting features, the code propagates labels to unlabeled data in the feature space. Here's how it works:

### 1. Data Preparation

- True and false features are fetched from the feature lake using `fetch_the_whole_features`.
- Labeled and unlabeled text data is tokenized, encoded, and features are extracted using RoBERTa model.

### 2. Concatenation

- Labeled text features are concatenated with the whole set of labeled features.
- Concatenated features and labels are prepared for training.

### 3. Writing Features to Database

- Labeled text features are written back to the feature lake.

### 4. KNN Classification

- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained on the concatenated features and labels.
- If weights are provided, a weighted KNN classifier is utilized.
- Predictions are made for the unlabeled text features.

### 5. Returning Predictions

- Predictions for unlabeled data are returned.

## Conclusion

The code effectively performs feature extraction using RoBERTa and propagates labels to unlabeled data in the feature space using a KNN classifier. It leverages Supabase for data storage and retrieval, and ensures memory management for efficient processing.
